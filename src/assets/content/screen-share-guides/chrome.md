# Chrome Screen Sharing Guide

## Overview

This guide will walk you through the process of sharing your screen in Google Chrome. Screen sharing allows you to broadcast your entire screen, a specific application window, or a browser tab to other participants.

## Prerequisites

- Google Chrome browser (version 72 or later)
- A website or application requesting screen sharing access
- System permissions enabled for screen sharing

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Respond to Screen Share Prompt

When an application requests screen sharing access, Chrome will display a prompt in the address bar:

> Note: If you don't see the prompt, click the camera icon in the address bar.

### 2. Choose What to Share

Chrome offers three sharing options:
