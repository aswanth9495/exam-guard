### Common Configuration Options for Violations

Each violation in the proctoring library can be customized using the following common configuration properties:

-   **enabled** (boolean): Specifies whether the violation detection is active. Default is true.
    
-   **showAlert** (boolean): Controls whether an alert should be shown when the violation occurs. Default is true.
    
-   **recordViolation** (boolean): Indicates whether to log the violation event. Default is true.
    

These settings can be overridden for each individual violation as needed.

### Violation Events Documentation

The proctoring library emits various events related to detected violations. Each event provides information about the type of violation and its details. Here's a breakdown of the events and associated methods for handling them:

#### 1. handleViolation(type, value = null, forceDisqualify = false)

-   **Purpose**: This method handles the detection of a violation by:
    
    -   Creating a violation object with the type, value, and timestamp.
        
    -   Showing a warning alert if configured.
        
    -   Recording the violation if configured.
        
    -   Dispatching a violation event.
        
    -   Checking if the user should be disqualified based on the violation count.
        
-   **Parameters**:
    
    -   type (string): The type of violation as defined in this.config.
        
    -   value (any, optional): Additional value or context associated with the violation.
        
    -   forceDisqualify (boolean, optional): If true, forces immediate disqualification regardless of the configured threshold.
        
-   **Behavior**:
    
    -   If alerts are enabled for the violation type, it displays a warning message.
        
    -   Records the violation if recording is enabled.
        
    -   Dispatches a violation event for further handling or logging.
        
    -   Checks if the user has reached the threshold for disqualification and disqualifies the user if needed.
        

#### 2. on(violationType, callback)

-   **Purpose**: This method allows the attachment of a callback function to a specific violation type event.
    
-   **Parameters**:
    
    -   violationType (string): The type of violation to listen for. It should match one of the configured violation types.
        
    -   callback (function): The function to be called when the violation event is triggered. Receives the total count of violations of the specified type and the event object.
        
-   **Behavior**:
    
    -   Adds an event listener for the specified violation type.
        
    -   Calls the provided callback function with the total count of violations of that type and the event object whenever the violation occurs.
        

#### 3. getTotalViolationsCountByType(type)

-   **Purpose**: Retrieves the total number of violations of a specific type.
    
-   **Parameters**:
    
    -   type (string): The type of violation to count.
        
-   **Returns**:
    
    -   (number): The count of violations of the specified type.
        
-   **Behavior**:
    
    -   Filters the list of recorded violations to count occurrences of the specified type.
        

#### 4. getTotalViolationsCount()

-   **Purpose**: Retrieves the total number of all recorded violations.
    
-   **Returns**:
    
    -   (number): The total count of all violations.
        
-   **Behavior**:
    
    -   Returns the length of the violationEvents array, representing the total number of recorded violations.
        

### Example Usage

-   **Handling a Specific Violation**:
    
    ```
    proctor.on('tabSwitch', (count, event) => { console.log(`Tab switch detected. Total violations: ${count}`); });
    ```
    
-   **Getting Total Violations Count**:
    
    ```
    const totalViolations = proctor.getTotalViolationsCount(); console.log(`Total violations: ${totalViolations}`);
    ```
    
-   **Handling and Forcing Disqualification**:
    
    ```
    proctor.handleViolation('tabSwitch', null, true);
    ```
    

### Compatibility Check

The compatibility check configuration ensures that the proctoring system verifies the user's environment to meet specific criteria. The configuration is used to perform various checks and manage their outcomes.

#### **Compatibility Check Configuration Options**

1.  enable (boolean):
    
    -   **Description**: Indicates whether compatibility checks are enabled.
        
    -   **Default**: true
        
2.  showAlert (boolean):
    
    -   **Description**: Controls whether an alert should be shown when a compatibility check fails.
        
    -   **Default**: true
        

#### **Compatibility Check Workflow**

1.  **Initialization**: When the proctoring system starts, it runs an initial compatibility check and sets an interval to repeat these checks every 20 seconds.
    
2.  **Checking**: The system performs the following checks:
    
    -   **Webcam**: Ensures that the webcam is accessible.
        
    -   **Network Speed**: Verifies if the network speed is adequate.
        
    -   **Fullscreen**: Checks if the application is running in fullscreen mode.
        
3.  **Handling Results**:
    
    -   **Success**: If all checks pass, a success callback is triggered.
        
    -   **Failure**: If any check fails, a failure callback is triggered, and a disqualification timer starts if needed.
        
4.  **Disqualification**:
    
    -   If a failure is detected and the compatibility check fails repeatedly, the user is disqualified after a predefined timeout period (15 seconds).
        

#### **Method Details**

1.  runCompatibilityChecks(onSuccess, onFailure)
    
    -   **Purpose**: Executes the compatibility checks and invokes the appropriate callback based on the result.
        
    -   **Parameters**:
        
        -   onSuccess (function): Callback function to handle successful checks.
            
        -   onFailure (function): Callback function to handle failed checks.
            
    -   **Example**:
        
        ```
        proctor.runCompatibilityChecks(
          (passedChecks) => {
            console.log('Compatibility checks passed:', passedChecks);
          },
          (failedCheck, passedChecks) => {
            console.log('Compatibility check failed:', failedCheck);
            console.log('Passed checks:', passedChecks);
          }
        );
        
        ```
        
2.  startCompatibilityChecks()
    
    -   **Purpose**: Begins running compatibility checks at regular intervals and handles their results.
        
    -   **Example**:
        
        ```
        proctor.startCompatibilityChecks(
          (passedChecks) => {
            console.log('Compatibility checks passed:', passedChecks);
          },
          (failedCheck, passedChecks) => {
            console.log('Compatibility check failed:', failedCheck);
            console.log('Passed checks:', passedChecks);
          }
        );
        
        ```
        
3.  stopCompatibilityChecks()
    
    -   **Purpose**: Stops ongoing compatibility checks and any associated timers.
        
    -   **Example**:
        
        ```
        proctor.stopCompatibilityChecks();
        ```

### Browser Compatibility

#### **Overview**

The proctoring library is bundled using Webpack 5.94.0, which is a powerful tool for managing and optimizing the bundle and its dependencies. Webpack handles many aspects of compatibility, but there are additional considerations for browser support, particularly for features like camera access and snapshot functionality.

The proctoring library is designed to work across modern browsers. However, to ensure broad compatibility and proper functionality, including camera and snapshot features, follow these guidelines:

1.  **Supported Browsers**:
    
    -   **Google Chrome**: Latest stable version and recent versions.
        
    -   **Mozilla Firefox**: Latest stable version and recent versions.
        
    -   **Safari**: Latest stable version and recent versions.
        
    -   **Microsoft Edge**: Latest stable version and recent versions.
        
2.  **Minimum Browser Requirements**:
    
    -   **Google Chrome**: Version 80+
        
    -   **Mozilla Firefox**: Version 80+
        
    -   **Safari**: Version 13+
        
    -   **Microsoft Edge**: Version 80+
        
3.  **Features and Support**:
    
    -   **Camera Access**: Uses the WebRTC API, which is widely supported in modern browsers but may have varying levels of support in older versions or less common browsers. Ensure permissions are granted for camera access.
        
    -   **Snapshot Functionality**: Relies on HTML5 Canvas for capturing snapshots. Most modern browsers support Canvas API, but ensure that your target browsers are updated.
